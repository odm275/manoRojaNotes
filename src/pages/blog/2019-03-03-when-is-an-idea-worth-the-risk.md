During the last month and a half, I started as a junior developer position at a company. My work is to operate as client support for a subset of CMS projects. For example, a ticket comes in for a change on a site, I go into Drupal's admin panel, look for the right section and make a change. Admittedly, this isn't the most rewarding type of job. However, it is my first job in the industry, so, I work hard at it and keep my sights humble for now. Nonetheless, I think of ideas that might be worthwhile that will  propel me into new opportunities wether that is inside or outside the company. 

This is when thinking about what idea is worth the risk comes into place.
